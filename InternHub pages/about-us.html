                <h2>Our mission</h2>
                Students often struggle to find suitable internships or training with companies because existing
                university systems offer limited opportunities and don’t cover all specialties. This gap makes it hard
                for many students to get real-world experience at the right time in their studies.
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>What we do</h2>
                This platform helps students discover internships and training opportunities that align with their
                skills and the subjects they’ve completed. By focusing on what students actually know and can do, the
                platform surfaces relevant, practical opportunities instead of generic listings.

            <div class="card">
            <h2>Why it’s better</h2>
            Unlike the university training system, which is limited in scope and availability, this platform expands
            access across specialties and organizations. It prioritizes fit by matching opportunities to each
            student’s skills and coursework, helping students find roles where they can contribute, learn, and grow
            faster.
